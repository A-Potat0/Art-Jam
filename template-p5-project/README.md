## Description

> This program was created for use on the computer as it has distinct characteristics only visible with a mouse. This program is interactive in the sense that is follows your curser and responds to your clicks.

> The base idea for this project was to represent the soul (aka. a representation of the self) by using a heart as is done in "Undertale". But as more aspects were added to the project i realised that I could represent myself in another manner as well. I have a tendency of being more of an observer than an active participant if I do not feel confident in the situation or am simply with people i don't know. As such the eye is a direct representation of me. But after i made the eye I realised that there was a saying that fit the situation perfectly " The eyes are the windows to the soul" this saying by itself describes my peice. Interesting isn't it. after i had finished the base aspects of the project, I felt like adding more of my personality to the project... as such I made it Chaotic. this is somwhat seen in the eye ever persuing your mouse, but it is mainly seen in the blinking that can be activated with the mouse. this was a nice project and i could see myself retuning in the future to add unhinged additions to this program.
